An application for learning foreign languages.

A semester project that was driven by my enthusiasm and desire to make it "as perfect as I can."  

The application has certain functionality that can be easily expanded, but it suffers from poor structure and project file organization (especially the classes).  
The best approach would be to simply look at the result without trying to understand the source code, as it is poorly written, and Iâ€™m embarrassed to share it.  

The focus was on functionality and the visual part of the application. Development is suspended indefinitely.  

P.S. Custom fonts were used in the original.
